# Intelligent Resume Screening System

This repository contains the implementation of an end-to-end **intelligent resume filtering pipeline**, designed for multilingual (Chinese-English) document image understanding and candidate-job semantic matching.

> üß† Built with enhanced OCR, layout-aware field extraction, deep semantic matching, and interpretable LLM-based scoring.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

Traditional resume screening methods struggle with scanned images, multilingual content, and complex layouts. This project proposes a **modular deep learning pipeline** to improve accuracy and interpretability in automated resume parsing and scoring.

### üéØ Main Objectives

- Enhance OCR performance for bilingual resume images
- Extract structured information using LayoutLMv3
- Score resume-job pairs using fine-tuned Cross-Encoders
- Generate human-readable explanations with Qwen2.5
- Support local, offline deployment for data privacy and speed

---

## üõ† System Architecture

The pipeline consists of the following major components:

1. **Image Super-Resolution**
   - Model: [Real-ESRGAN](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)
   - Purpose: Enhance low-resolution resume images

2. **OCR & Layout Extraction**
   - Model: [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR)
   - Converts images into structured key-value format

3. **Field-Level Information Extraction**
   - Model: [LayoutLMv3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/layoutlmv3-base)
   - Trained to extract fields like NAME, EDUCATION, WORK EXPERIENCE, etc.

4. **Semantic Matching & Scoring**
   - Model: Cross-Encoders (e.g., `ms-marco-MiniLM`, `Erlangshen-Roberta-110M`)
   - Computes a 0.0‚Äì1.0 relevance score between resume and job description

5. **Interpretability Layer**
   - Model: LoRA-tuned [Qwen2.5](https://github.com/QwenLM)
   - Generates {"score": float, "reason": string} style JSON outputs
